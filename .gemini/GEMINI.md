# Project Goal: Django Mid-Level App Tutorial

The user wants to learn Django in-depth by building a mid-level application step-by-step.
Each step should include:
-   Detailed explanation of the workflow.
-   Explanation of what is happening internally in Django.
-   Interactive guidance.

The ultimate goal is for the user to have a clear understanding of how Django applications work, including the internal mechanisms at each step.

## Application Idea: Simple Blog/Portfolio

To achieve the learning goal, we will build a simple blog or portfolio application. This will cover:
-   Models (data structures)
-   Views (logic)
-   Templates (presentation)
-   URLs (routing)
-   Admin interface
-   User authentication
-   Migrations
-   Static files

## Workflow:

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new Django project and app.
2.  **Model Definition:** Define basic models (e.g., Post, Comment).
3.  **Database Migrations:** Apply migrations to create database tables.
4.  **Admin Interface:** Register models with the admin site.
5.  **Views and URLs:** Create views to display data and define URL patterns.
6.  **Templates:** Design HTML templates to render data.
7.  **Forms (optional):** Create forms for user input.
8.  **User Authentication:** Implement user login/logout.
9.  **Deployment considerations (briefly):** Discuss basic deployment concepts.
